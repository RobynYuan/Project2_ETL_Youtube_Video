# Project2_ETL_Youtube_Video
In this project, we used two datasets for Youtube video from https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
The USvideos CSV file  includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos in the united states.  The other dataset is a very sturcture nested json file which contains the video category ID and the real category title name. In order to analyze the data using category based information such as the most popular category, we extracted the data from these two files and loaded the final dataframe into SQL. We also did a little analysis based on the category and found out music is the most popular trending video.
